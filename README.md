# SciViewer

Single Cell Interactive Viewer is an R shiny application that allows users to interactively visualize single cell datasets. The application contains two modules - 1) SciViewerIn: The input application that processes single cell data from .h5ad or .seurat format into either a local or remote database. 2) SciViewer: The main application that allows interactive visualization.
